Please note: I had difficulties with the language selection part, so i've used google first then chatGPT to solve the task. I've also used chatGPT to generate basic CSS to my components.
I've used these tools to figure out correct client side routing with Vue. Throughout my studies I've only worked with React so my understanding of what's happening under the hood is there, as i've used react router in my previous projects, but i was unable to master the syntax and the implementation of it in Vue.
I feel like I had to include this for you to know, as I wouldn't want to gain an unfair advantage above others for using these tools. I'm confident that my knowledge is there on how to work and set up these components and handle their logic, but I wasn't able to gain the knowledge required for these two tasks in this one week to do them just from memory. 
Thank you for the opportunity and for motivating me to start learning Vue. I actually like it more than React so from now on I'm going to master it for my no.1 library of choice for front end development.
